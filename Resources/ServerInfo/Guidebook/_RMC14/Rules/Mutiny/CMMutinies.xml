  # Mutinies require admin permission.
  All players, including hostile forces, must obtain admin permission before engaging riots, mutinies or similar activity.
  - Strikes, revolutions, riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden without permission.
  - Staff reserve the right to grant or deny mutinies, and to decide if the reason given is sufficient.
  - MPs are not able to mutiny and will always side with the acting CO.
  - Mutiny cannot occur during hijack, and any ongoing mutiny must be ended upon hijack.
  - Only the Acting Commander can be mutinied against. They must be given a chance to stand down peacefully.
  - During the mutiny, attacking any uninvolved, medical, or surrendered personnel is forbidden, as is perma-killing anyone involved.
  - If you have surrendered during a mutiny, you must remain as such.
  - You may not change sides unless you are surrendering.
  - Once concluded, all sides must be given medical treatment. CO or higher are able to deny treatment or battlefield execute mutineers.
  - Mutinies must have 5 members minimum.
  - Examples of mutiny reasons:
  - Commander incompetence, where the next in line would lead better.
  - Commander takes no actions in leading.
  - Commander refuses to allow evacuation.
