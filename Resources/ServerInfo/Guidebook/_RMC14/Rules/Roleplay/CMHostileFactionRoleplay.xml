  #Hostile Faction Roleplay Standards
  You do not have rules of engagement and may fire at Marine forces if:
  - You have not surrendered.
  - You have not accepted medical aid from the Marines.
  - You have not changed your faction uniform.
  - You have remained hostile to Marine forces.


  - If you are a hostile force attacking the Marines prior to hijack, [color=#ff0000]attacking newly spawned players in cryo is forbidden, let them have a chance to gear up before you attack them![/color] Avoiding the cryo rooms unless the Marines are using them as cover will be enough.
