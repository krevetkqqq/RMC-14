  #Don't harass or target players across rounds
  Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds or for actions outside of the game (this is referred to as "Metagrudging".)
  - Annoying players for in character reasons in the current round is fine; doing it across rounds or as a ghost role after they have interacted with you is not.
