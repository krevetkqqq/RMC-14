  #Don't quit a head role without notice.
  Don't quit a head role without notifying your chain of command or an admin.
  - If you do not want to play a role, do not opt-in for it.
  - Command roles help drive rounds. If you need to leave, use cryo or please admin-help your role and that you are leaving.
  - There is no need to wait for a reply when admin-helping that you need to disconnect as a head role.
