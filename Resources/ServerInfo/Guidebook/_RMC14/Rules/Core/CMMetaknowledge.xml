  #Don't use information gained out of character
  Don't use information gained from outside your character's knowledge to gain an advantage ("Metagaming").
  - Using information you gain from outside your own character's view and hearing to your advantage is strictly forbidden. You remember all events up until you fall unconscious. If you take a ghost role, unless otherwise stated, you do not remember anything from your past life.
