  #MP should try to remain non-lethal
  MP should try to remain non-lethal and effect arrests, except in the following special circumstances, where they may choose to use lethal force:
  - Lethal force is used against you (ex: firearms, disabling/stunning weapons, deadly melee weapons)
  - Suspect is wearing clothing or showing immediately dangerous equipment only used by enemy agents/hostile forces when applicable.
  - You determine that your life or the life of an innocent is in immediate danger.
  - The suspect is unable to be safely detained by less-lethal means. This includes suspects who continually resist efforts to be cuffed or continually manages to escape.
  - If no other reasonable options are readily available and allowing the suspect to continue would be an unreasonable danger to the ship/crew.
