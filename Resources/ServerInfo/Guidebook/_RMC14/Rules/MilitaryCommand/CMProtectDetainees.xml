  # MP must protect detainees in their custody
  MP are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability so as long as it does not come to unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew, or the ship at large to do so.
  - Brig times should generally not exceed 10 minutes unless the crime is permabrig-able.
  - Repeat offenders or hostile forces may be perma-brigged.
  - Military Police may choose to confiscate dangerous items (weapons, firearms) as well as items used to commission crimes or items that prove problematic in possession of the detainee (tools, insulated gloves, etc.).
  - Detainees that die in your custody must be revived unless they have been (legally) executed, or have committed suicide.
  - Those who willingly attempt to damage/destroy or escape from the permabrig may be executed.
  - Detainees in the brig have the right to know what they are being charged with, as well as basic medical aid, at least to the point they are no longer at risk of dying.
